# Registration Widget Developed With Jquery
This is a demo registration page. The main feature of this jquery-widget is that we can skip the "optional fields OR non-mandatory-fields" and move to the "next step" of the form. And later on we can fill those "optional-fields" by going back to that particular step. By this we can track the "skipped optional-fields".
